class CrossTable(object):
	__doc__ = '''
	Class for generating formula tables for FT-ICR MS sample sets, generating
	summary tables and statistics, and correlating formula abundances with
	environmental measurements.

	Parameters
	----------
	intensities : 2D array-like
		Either 2D np.ndarray or pd.Dataframe of all formula intensities for
		all samples.

	drop_int_above : none, int, or float
		Tells the method whether to drop formulae that represent greater
		than some amount of the total intensity -- i.e. fliers. The value
		of `drop_int_above` is the percent of total intensity (i.e. the
		relative abundance) value above which peaks will be dropped.
		Defaults to `None`.

	drop_high_OC : Boolean
		If `True`, formulae with O/C ratio above 1.0 will be dropped.
		Defaults to `True`.

	drop_high_HC : Boolean
		If `True`, formulae with H/C ratio above 2.0 will be dropped.
		Defaults to `True`.

	formulae : list
		List of formula names. If `None`, pulls formula names from 
		`intensities` index values. Defaults to `None`.

	rescale : `None` or str
		String telling the method how to rescale peak intensities, either
		'fraction', 'max_peak', or None. If 'fraction', scales intensities such
		that the sum for *each sample* is equal to 100. If 'max_peak', scales
		intensities such that the largest peak *in each sample* is
		equal to 100.

	sam_names : `None` or list
		List of sample names. If `None`, pulls sample names from column names
		of `intensities`. Defaults to `None`.

	Warnings
	--------
	UserWarning
		If `sam_names` = `None` and `intensities` does not contain sample
		names, then names each sample according to column number.

	Notes
	-----
	When calculating correlation van Krevelen plots, `CrossTable` scaling
	should be set to 'fraction'. This way, it is the relative abundance within
	a given sample that is correlated with environmental parameters.

	Examples
	--------
	Generating an arbitrary bare-bones cross table containing made-up
	formulae::

		#import modules
		import fouriertransform as ft
		import numpy as np
		import pandas as pd

		#generate arbitrary data
		intensities = np.ones([2,2])
		formulae = ['C1H1O1N0S0P0', 'C2H2O1N0S1P0']
		sam_names = ['sample_1','sample_2']

		#create crosstable
		ct = ft.CrossTable(
			intensities,
			formulae = formulae,
			rescale = None,
			sam_names = sam_names)

	Importing all EnviroOrg files contained within a directory and combining
	to for a cross table::

		#input directory name
		dir_name = '~/Desktop/EO_directory'

		#create crosstable
		ct = ft.CrossTable.from_eo(
			dir_name,
			file_names = 'all', #can replace with list of names for subset
			rescale = 'fraction',
			drop_int_above = 5, #drops fliers above 5 pct total intensity
			drop_high_HC = True, #drops peaks with H/C > 2
			drop_high_OC = True) #drops peaks with O/C > 1

	Generating a summary table for the samples contained within the
	``CrossTable`` instance `ct`::

		#make the summary table
		sum_tab = ct.generate_summary()

		#save as csv
		sum_tab.to_csv('~/Desktop/summary_table.csv')

	Plotting the cross table data in van Krevelen space. You can plot either
	intensities or class for a single sample, the difference between two
	samples, or correlations between relative intensities across all samples
	and some other environmental parameter (e.g. bulk carbon isotopes). For
	all plotting methods, matplotlib scatterplot keyword arguments can be
	used.

	Plotting a single sample's intensity. Here, I'm taking the log of
	intensities to see a wider dynamic range::

		#import additional modules
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

		#extract sample name
		s = 'sample_1'

		#make axis
		fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)

		#make van krevelen plot
		ax = ct.plot_sample_vk(
			s,
			ax = ax,
			plot_type = 'intensity',
			log = True,
			edgecolor = 'w',
			s = 40,
			cmap = 'YlGnBu')

	Plotting compounds by class for a single sample::

		#make axis
		fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)

		#make van krevelen plot
		ax = ct.plot_sample_vk(
			s,
			ax = ax
			plot_type = 'class',
			edgecolor = 'w',
			s = 40)

	Plotting the difference between two samples. Formulae that are present
	in 'sample_1' but not present in 'sample_2' will be plotted and color
	coded according to class::

		#extract second sample name
		s2 = 'sample_2'

		#make axis
		fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)

		#make van krevelen plot
		ax = ct.plot_difference_vk(
			s,
			s2,
			ax = ax,
			edgecolor = 'w',
			s = 40)

	Plotting correlations with some independently measured environmental
	parameter, here called `env_param`. You can either plot correlations as
	Pearson or Spearman coefficients, and you can decide what fraction of
	the total samples a formula must be contained in in order to be considered
	for correlation. You can also determine the significance cutoff (alpha)
	and can only consider certain compound classes (i.e. CHO, CHON, CHOS)
	rather than all compounds. Resulting plot only retains statistically
	significant formulae. Resulting correlation coefficients and p-values for
	statistically significant formulae are also stored in 'stats'.
	An example::

		#make axis
		fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2)

		#make van krevelen plot for all formulae
		ax[0], stats = ct.plot_correlation_vk(
			env_param,
			ax = ax[0],
			corr_type = 'Spearman',
			f = 1,
			alpha = 0.05,
			cmpd_cls = 'all',
			edgecolor = 'w',
			s = 40,
			cmap = 'coolwarm',
			vmin = -1,
			vmax = 1)	

		#make van krevelen plot for CHON formulae only
		ax[1], stats = ct.plot_correlation_vk(
			env_param,
			ax = ax[1],
			corr_type = 'Spearman',
			f = 1,
			alpha = 0.05,
			cmpd_cls = 'CHON',
			edgecolor = 'w',
			s = 40,
			cmap = 'coolwarm',
			vmin = -1,
			vmax = 1)	

	Any figure can then be saved to the drive according to::

		fig.savefig('~/Desktop/van_krevelen_figure.pdf')

		'''
		Classmethod to generate a ``CrossTable`` instance by inputting 
		EnviroOrg files generated for each sample from a given sample set.

		Parameters
		----------
		dir_path : str
			String containing the (absolute) path pointing to the directory
			containing files to be imported.

		drop_int_above : none, int, or float
			Tells the method whether to drop formulae that represent greater
			than some amount of the total intensity -- i.e. fliers. The value
			of `drop_int_above` is the percent of total intensity (i.e. the
			relative abundance) value above which peaks will be dropped.
			Defaults to `None`.

		drop_high_OC : Boolean
			If `True`, formulae with O/C ratio above 1.0 will be dropped.
			Defaults to `True`.

		drop_high_HC : Boolean
			If `True`, formulae with H/C ratio above 2.0 will be dropped.
			Defaults to `True`.

		file_names : str or list
			Either a list of strings containing the filenames to be imported or
			the string 'all'. If 'all', method will automatically import all 
			files within the provided directory. Defaults to 'all'.

		rescale : str or None
			Tells the method if and how to rescale peak intensities for cross-
			sample comparisons. Either `None`, 'fraction', or 'max_peak'. If
			'fraction', scales each sample such that the sum of intensities 
			for a given sample is equal to unity. If 'max_peak', scales such
			that the most intense peak detected in each sample is equal to 100
			and all other peaks are scaled accordingly. Defaults to `None`.

		Raises
		------
		FileError
			If the directory path does not exist.

		FileError
			If the inputted file does not exist or is not in .csv format.

		ValueError
			If the value for `rescale` is not 'fraction', 'max_peak', or 
			`None`.

		ValueError
			If `drop_int_above` is not `None`, float, or int.

		Notes
		-----
		This function requires that inputted files are in .csv format. File
		names will be used as sample names in resulting cross table (omitting
		the .csv extension), so using shortened filenames is encouraged for
		brevity.

				all, \n
				CHO, \n
				CHON, \n
				CHOS \n
			
			Defaults to 'all'.

		corr_type : str
			String saying which statistical method to use for correlation.
			Currently accepts:

				Pearson, \n
				Spearman \n

			Defaults to 'Pearson'.

		f : float
			The fraction of total samples in which a formula must be present
			in order to be considered for correlation, ranging between 0.0
			and 1.0. If some samples are missing env_param data, then f is the
			fraction of retained samples in which a formula must be present.
			Defaults to 1.

		Returns
		-------
		ax : plt.axis
			Axis containing the van Krevelen plot of interest.

		stats : df.DataFrame
			Dataframe of resulting r (for Pearson) or rho (for Spearman)
			values (collectively termed 'corr') and corresponding p-values for
			all formulae that are included in the plot.

		Raises
		------
		TypeError
			If `env_param` is not list, np.ndarray, or pd.Series.

		LengthError
			If `env_param` is not of length `nS` (if list or array only).

		ValueError
			If `fraction_present` is not between 0 and 1.

		LengthError
			If number of samples is less than 3.

		ValueError
			If `corr_type` is not 'Pearson' or 'Spearman'.

		ValueError
			If `cmpd_cls` is not 'all', 'CHO', 'CHON', or 'CHOS'.

		TypeError
			If `intensities` is not ``pd.DataFrame``.

		TypeError
			If `env_param` is not ``pd.Series``.

		TypeError
			If `alpha` is not float between 0 and 1.

		SampleError
			If sample names in `env_param` and `intensities` do not match.

		plot_difference_vk
			Function for plotting presence/absense differences between two
			samples.

		plot_sample_vk
			Function for plotting a van Krevelen diagram for a single sample,
			color coded either by peak intensity or by compound class.
